# Alien Talks

## Instructions

- We need to register a click event handler on the aliens (buttons) with jQuery.

* When one of the alien is clicked, a message ('ðŸ’¬') should appear right underneath the alien (in the talk class) that was clicked.
* Both aliens should not talk at the same time.
* You might need to use either `this` or `event.target` in your code.
