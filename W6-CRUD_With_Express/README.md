Hello Labbers, 

Thanks for coming to my lecture on CRUD with express. You will find all the info on the slides attached here.

We covered all CRUD operations except the update part due to running out of time, I have added that in the final code though. 

Also some students had followup questions so we kind of implemented a small login functionality using cookies, so you might find code related to it in the repo as well.

As always, please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions to the material covered here.

My office hourse: 3 PM to PM EST
Mentorship hours: 5 PM EST to 8:00 PM EST every day of the week except Friday.

As always, being an awesome dev is a lifelong learning journey, strive on! ðŸš€
